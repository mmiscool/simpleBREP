### Revised Implementation Plan

    1. **NURBS Functionality**
        * **NURBS Class**: Create a `NURBS` class that can handle the mathematical representation of curves and surfaces, including methods for evaluation and derivative calculations.
        * **Special Case Curves**: Implement special cases for primitive shapes like `Line`, `Circle`, `Arc`, and `Ellipse` as specific instances or subclasses of the `NURBS` class, leveraging the general NURBS functionality for computations.
    2. **Modeling Primitives** **Primitive Shape Classes**: Define classes for basic geometric shapes like `Line`, `Circle`, `Arc`, and `Ellipse` that use the NURBS representation.**Parameters and Methods**: Each class should have properties denoting its geometric parameters (e.g., start/end points for lines, center/radius for circles) and methods for basic operations, depending on the NURBS functionalities.
    3. **Boundary Representation**
        * **Create BREP Classes**: Implement `Vertex`, `Edge`, and `Face` classes to represent the essential elements of BREP.
        * **Relationships**: Establish relationships among these elements (e.g., edges belong to faces, faces have vertices).
        * **Storage Structures**: Decide on data structures that efficiently store lists of vertices, edges, and faces.
    4. **Topology Management**
        * **Topological Relationships**: Implement methods within the `Face`, `Edge`, and `Vertex` classes to manage connectivity and update relationships as geometry changes.
        * **Consistency Checks**: Develop methods for verifying topological integrity following geometry modifications.
    5. **Solid and Surface Modeling**
        * **Solid Object Class**: Create a `Solid` class that encapsulates multiple `Face` objects to represent a closed volume.
        * **Surface Class**: Additionally, implement a `Surface` class representing open surfaces using NURBS or polygon meshes.
    6. **Boolean Operations**
        * **Union Method**: Implement methods for performing the union of two solids, handling intersections and merging the resulting volumes.
        * **Intersection and Difference Operations**: Develop similar methods for intersection and difference operations with valid BREP representations.
    7. **Feature-Based Modeling**
        * **Feature Classes**: Define classes for various features (e.g., `Extrude`, `Cut`, `Revolve`) that inherit from a base `Feature` class.
        * **Feature Application**: Implement how each feature modifies or generates BREP entities, encapsulating logic to affect the underlying geometry.
    8. **Mesh Generation**
        * **Triangulation Algorithm**: Implement a function to generate a triangulated mesh from faces, ensuring that the mesh accurately represents the original geometry.
        * **Mesh Representation**: Create a `Mesh` class to hold triangular elements and their connectivity.
    9. **Manipulation Functions**
        * **Transformation Methods**: Provide methods for applying transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) within geometric entity classes.
        * **Update Topology**: Ensure that transformations maintain consistency in the representation of the topology.

### Additional Considerations

    * **Testing and Documentation**: Maintain a strong emphasis on testing each component as it's developed, while ensuring thorough documentation for clarity and maintenance.
    * **Optimization and Modularity**: Continue with optimization and maintain a modular setup for future extensions or modifications.

This updated plan places NURBS functionality at the forefront, recognizing its role in supporting the representation of primitive shapes, which can now directly leverage the NURBS capabilities during their implementation. Thank you for pointing out that relationship!
