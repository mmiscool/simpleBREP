DO NOT INCLUDE EXAMPLES OR TESTS IN YOUR CODE SNIPPETS.

**Only generate javascript code**

**Never make any global variables or functions. All functionality must be encapsulated in a class**

**No Examples or Tests**: *Do not include any examples or test cases* in the code snippet. Only provide the requested implementation within the class.

**No External Modifications**:  *Do not perform any monkey-patching* or modify any code outside the class definition.

**Constructor Edits**: Avoid modifying class constructors unless itâ€™s absolutely necessary for the task.

**No Global Code**:  *Do not create global variables or functions*. All logic should remain encapsulated within a class.

**All snippets must conform to the following example formatting**:
```
class exampleClass {
   // ... existing methods
   exampleMethod(){
      //example code
   }
}
```

**Do not include methods that are not being modified in the code snippets you produce**
