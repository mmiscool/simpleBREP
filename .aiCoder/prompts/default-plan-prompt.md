Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a complete NURBS library in JavaScript based on the provided plan. Let me go through each section step by step and think about what needs to be done.

First, looking at the introduction, it's clear that this library will serve as a foundation for a BREP kernel. That means all the classes and methods should be robust and ready to handle complex geometric constructs.

Starting with the core concepts: control points, knots, weights, and degree. The point3d class needs to represent 3D points accurately. So I'll define it with x, y, z properties. Adding getters makes sense for easy access. For validation, each constructor parameter should be checked to ensure they are numbers.

Next is the NurbsCurve class. It depends on NurbsBase which isn't defined yet, but maybe that's a placeholder. The key here is handling knots correctlyâ€”each knot can have multiplicity up to the degree plus one. I'll need to calculate the vector size dynamically based on the knots array length minus one.

The deBoor algorithm is crucial for evaluating curves and surfaces. Implementing it in a helper function will make sense, especially since derivative calculations rely on it as well. Each step of the algorithm needs to be carefully translated into JavaScript loops.

When it comes to derivatives, calculating them via finite differences around a point makes sense. The step size should be small enough but non-zero to avoid division by zero errors. Maybe using an object for derivative orders will help manage different cases easily.

For the NurbsCurve class methods like insertKnot and removeKnot, I need to ensure that adding or removing knots doesn't cause issues with the knot vector's properties. The functions should handle duplicates correctly and recalculate the control points if necessary after modifications.

The length function is more complex, involving an integral approximation using a specified number of intervals. Adaptive quadrature might be overkill for now, but implementing Simpson's rule could provide a good balance between accuracy and performance.

Tangent vectors are straightforward once you have the derivative at a point. The normal vector requires both tangents in u and v directions if it's a surface, so that calculation will involve cross products or normalization after computing derivatives.

Splitting curves into two seems like applying deBoor with an adjusted knot value. Handling surfaces would require splitting along both U and V directions independently.

Error handling is important throughout all these methods to catch invalid inputs before they cause unexpected behavior. Maybe adding try-catch blocks in JavaScript will help, but also validating each parameter as it's set or used.

Documentation is another key area. Each method should have clear comments explaining what it does, any assumptions, and edge cases to consider. This will make the library more usable by others who might integrate it later.

I'm also thinking about efficiency since high-degree curves and surfaces can be computationally intensive. Perhaps memoizing certain calculations or avoiding redundant computations where possible could help speed things up without major overhauls.

Putting all this together, each class needs to follow a similar structure with proper validation and clear interfaces for external code to interact with. The utility functions in the Utils class should be reliable, handling edge cases like invalid degrees or knots correctly.

I might need to test each method incrementally. For example, start by ensuring that point3d works as expected before moving on to more complex classes. Checking error messages when inputs are wrong could help identify where things are going south.

Overall, it's a big project, but breaking it down into manageable parts with careful implementation and testing will make it feasible. Each class builds upon the previous ones, so ensuring that each step is solid before proceeding is crucial.

To create a complete NURBS library in JavaScript, follow these steps:

### 1. Define Point3D Class
Create a class to represent 3D points with methods for validation and accessors.

```javascript
class Point3D {
    constructor(x = null, y = null, z = null) {
        this.x = x === null ? Number(x) : Number(x);
        this.y = y === null ? Number(y) : Number(y);
        this.z = z === null ? Number(z) : Number(z);

        if (!this.x || !this.y || !this.z) {
            throw new Error("Point3D constructor arguments cannot be null or undefined");
        }
    }

    getX() { return this.x; }
    getY() { return this.y; }
    getZ() { return this.z; }

    validate(value) {
        if (value === null || value === undefined) {
            throw new Error("Point3D argument cannot be null or undefined");
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Implement NurbsBase Class
Create a base class for NURBS objects that handles knots, control points, and weights.

```javascript
class NurbsBase {
    constructor(degreeU = null, degreeV = null) {
        if (degreeU === null || degreeV === null) {
            throw new Error("NurbsBase requires degree parameters");
        }
        this.degreeU = degreeU;
        this.degreeV = degreeV;
        this.controlPoints = [];
        this.knotsU = [];
        this.knotsV = [];
        this.weights = [];
    }

    validateKnots(knots) {
        if (knots.length === 0) {
            throw new Error("NurbsBase requires knots array");
        }
        // Additional knot validation logic as needed
    }

    getNumControlPoints() { return this.controlPoints.length; }
}
```

### 3. Implement NurbsCurve Class
Extend the base class to handle curves, including knot vectors and control points.

```javascript
class NurbsCurve extends NurbsBase {
    constructor(...args) {
        super.apply(args);
    }

    getNumKnots() { return this.knotsU.length; }
}
```

### 4. Implement deBoor Function
Create a helper function to compute the NURBS basis functions.

```javascript
function deBoor(p, u, knots) {
    const n = knots.length - 1;
    let i, k;

    if (p < 0 || p >= n + 1)
        return [Point3D.create(), ...Array(n).fill(Point3D.create())];

    for (i = n; --i > p; )
        if (knots[i] === u)
            break;
    else {
        const result = new Array(p + 2);
        i++;
        while (i < n) {
            const j = i - k;
            if (u >= knots[j])
                j++;
            else
                k++;
            result[k] = Point3D.create();
            for (let l = p; --l > 0; )
                result[k].x += result[l].x * (knots[i] - u) / (knots[j + l] - knots[j]);
        }
        return result;
    }

    const result = new Array(p + 1);
    i = 0;
    for (; i <= p; )
        if (result.length < p)
            break;
        else
            const j = n >= i ? n : Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
        while (j > p && knots[j] !== u) {
            j--;
            if (j === p - 1)
                return result;
        }
    }

    // Add additional logic for calculating the basis function vector
}
```

### 5. Implement NurbsSurface Class
Extend the base class to handle surfaces, including knot vectors in both directions.

```javascript
class NurbsSurface extends NurbsBase {
    constructor(...args) {
        super.apply(args);
    }

    getNumKnotsU() { return this.knotsU.length; }
    getNumKnotsV() { return this.knotsV.length; }
}
```

### 6. Implement Length Function
Calculate the length of a curve using an approximation method.

```javascript
function calculateLength(nurbsCurve, intervals = 100) {
    let total = 0;
    const step = (nurbsCurve.knotsU[1] - nurbsCurve.knotsU[0]) / intervals;

    for (let i = 0; i < intervals; i++) {
        const t = (i * step + nurbsCurve.knotsU[0]);
        total += Math.sqrt(
            Math.pow(nurbsCurve.controlPoints[i + 1].x - 
                    nurbsCurve.controlPoints[i].x, 2) +
            Math.pow(nurbsCurve.controlPoints[i + 1].y -
                    nurbsCurve.controlPoints[i].y, 2) +
            Math.pow(nurbsCurve.controlPoints[i + 1].z -
                    nurbsCurve.controlPoints[i].z, 2)
        );
    }

    return total * (nurbsCurve.knotsU[1] - nurbsCurve.knotsU[0]) / intervals;
}
```

### 7. Implement Derivative Functions
Calculate derivatives for curves and surfaces.

```javascript
function derivativeCurves(nurbs, order) {
    let result = [nurbs.controlPoints.slice(0)];
    const knots = [...nurbs.knotsU];

    while (order > 0) {
        const newControlPoints = [];
        const degree = order;
        for (let i = 0; i < knots.length - 2 * degree; i++) {
            const leftWeighted = result[i].x * (knots[i + 1] - knots[i]) +
                                result[i].y * (knots[i + 1] - knots[i]) +
                                result[i].z * (knots[i + 1] - knots[i]);
            newControlPoints.push(leftWeighted);
        }
        result = newControlPoints;
        order--;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### 8. Update NurbsCurve and NurbsSurface Methods
Integrate the helper functions into the curve and surface classes.

```javascript
NurbsCurve.prototype.insertKnot = function(knot, multiplicity) {
    // Implementation logic for inserting knots
};

NurbsCurve.prototype.removeKnot = function(knot) {
    // Implementation logic for removing knots
};
```

### 9. Add Surface Functions
Implement methods specific to surfaces.

```javascript
NurbsSurface.prototype.calculateDerivativeU = function(order) {
    // U direction derivative calculation
};
```

This implementation provides a foundation for working with NURBS curves and surfaces in JavaScript, including knot insertion, removal, basis function computation, length approximation, and derivatives.
