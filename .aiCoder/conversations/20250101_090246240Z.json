It will encompass curve and surface evaluations, transformations, derivative calculations, intersection operations, parameterization, continuity assessment, visualization support, and advanced manipulation capabilities.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n-   **Knot Vector:**  A sequence of non-decreasing numbers that define the parameter domain of a NURBS curve or surface.\n-   **Control Points:** Points in space that influence the shape of the NURBS curve or surface.\n-   **Degree:** The degree of the polynomial basis functions used to define the NURBS.\n-   **Dimension:** The spatial dimension of the control points (2D or 3D).\n-   **Rationality:** NURBS allow for weighted control points which are specified by homogenous coordinates. This makes them \"rational\".\n-   **De Boor Algorithm:** A numerical algorithm used to calculate the value of a NURBS curve or surface at a specified parameter value.\n\n## Classes\n\n### 1. `NurbsCurve`\n\n-   Represents a NURBS curve defined by its knot vector, control points, degree, and dimension.\n\n-   **Properties:**\n    -   `knotVector` (Array): Array of non-decreasing knot values.\n    -   `controlPoints` (Array of Arrays): Array of control points, where each control point is an array representing its coordinates and the homogenous weight coordinate (e.g., `[x, y, weight]` for 2D or `[x, y, z, weight]` for 3D).\n    -   `degree` (Number): Degree of the NURBS curve.\n    -   `dimension` (Number): Dimensionality of the curve (2 or 3).\n\n-   **Methods:**\n\n    1.  `constructor(knotVector, controlPoints, degree, dimension)`\n        -   **Input Arguments:**\n            -   `knotVector` (Array): The knot vector for the curve.\n            -   `controlPoints` (Array of Arrays): The array of control points and their weights.\n            -   `degree` (Number): The degree of the curve.\n            -   `dimension` (Number): The dimension of the curve.\n        -   **Description:** Initializes a new `NurbsCurve` instance.
