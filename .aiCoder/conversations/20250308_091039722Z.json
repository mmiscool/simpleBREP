      "content": "Okay, let's build a Tic-Tac-Toe game!  Here's a plan for how we can approach this:\n\n**1. Game Board Representation:**\n\n*   We'll use a 2D array (3x3) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\n*   Each cell in the array can hold:\n    *   `null` or `''` (empty)\n    *   `'X'` (player X)\n    *   `'O'` (player O)\n\n**2. Displaying the Board:**\n\n*   We'll create a function to print the board to the console in a user-friendly format.\n*   It will show the rows and columns clearly, making it easy for players to see the game state.\n\n**3. Player Input:**\n\n*   We'll need a way to get input from players to choose their move (row and column).\n*   We can use `prompt()` in JavaScript for simple console input.\n*   We'll need to validate the input to ensure it's within the board boundaries and the chosen cell is empty.\n\n**4. Updating the Board:**\n\n*   A function to update the board array with the player's move ('X' or 'O') at the specified row and column.\n\n**5. Checking for a Win:**\n\n*   We'll need a function to check if a player has won after each move.\n*   This involves checking:\n    *   All rows for three in a row.\n    *   All columns for three in a row.\n    *   Both diagonals for three in a row.\n\n**6. Checking for a Draw:**\n\n*   If no one wins and all cells are filled, it's a draw. We'll need a function to check for this condition.\n\n**7. Game Logic and Turn Management:**\n\n*   We'll create the main game loop to:\n    *   Initialize the board.\n    *   Determine the current player (start with 'X').\n    *   Display the board.\n    *   Get player input.\n    *   Update the board.\n    *   Check for win or draw.\n    *   Switch players.\n    *   Repeat until the game ends (win or draw).\n\n**Let's start by creating the basic structure and the board representation in `ticTacToe.js`.**\n\n```javascript\n// ticTacToe.js\n\n// 1. Game Board Representation\nlet board = [\n    [null, null, null],\n    [null, null, null],\n    [null, null, null]\n];\n\n// 2. Displaying the Board (Let's add this function next)\n\n// ... (rest of the code will be added step-by-step)\n```\n\nNow, let's add the function to display the board.  How would you like the board to look in the console?  For example, we could use lines and separators to make it visually clear. Let me know if you have a preference, or I can suggest a simple format!",
