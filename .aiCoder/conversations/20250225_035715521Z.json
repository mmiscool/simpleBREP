Let me think about what that involves.\n\nFirst, I remember that NURBS curves use control points, each with a weight. So the getWeights method should return an array of these weights.\n\nLooking at the structure, the NurbsCurve class probably has a private property like _controlPoints. Each control point is an object with x, y, and weight properties.\n\nSo, the method needs to loop through each control point in _controlPoints. For each point, I'll extract the weight and add it to a new array.\n\nI should initialize an empty array, then use a for loop to iterate over each point. Pushing each weight into the array.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct, using this._controlPoints and accessing the weight property correctly.\n\nPutting it all together, the method initializes the array, loops through each point, and collects the weights. That should do it.\n</think>\n\nHere is the implementation of the `getWeights` method for the `NurbsCurve` class:\n\n```\nclass NurbsCurve {\n    getWeights() {\n        const weights = [];\n        for (const point of this._controlPoints) {\n            weights.push(point.weight);\n        }\n        return weights;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method iterates over each control point in the `_controlPoints‚Äù array and collects their weights into a new array, which it then returns.",

  "title": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to write the getWeights method for the NurbsCurve class. I remember that NURBS curves use control points, and each control point has a weight associated with it. So, the getWeights method probably needs to extract these weights from each control point and return them as an array.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the structure of the NurbsCurve class. It likely has a property, maybe called _controlPoints, which is an array of control points. Each control point might be an object with a 'weight' property.\n\nSo, the getWeights method should create an empty array to store the weights. Then, it should loop through each control point in the _controlPoints array. For each point, it should push the weight into the weights array.\n\nI should also consider edge cases. What if there are no control points? Then the method should return an empty array. I don't think there's any error handling needed beyond that since the method is straightforward.\n\nI'll start by initializing an empty array. Then, use a for loop to iterate over each control point. For each point, access the weight property and add it to the array. Finally, return the array.\n\nI think that's all. It's a simple method, but I need to make sure it correctly accesses the weights from each control point.\n</think>\n\nThe `getWeights` method in the `NurbsCurve` class retrieves the weights of the control points.\n\n```javascript\nclass NurbsCurve {\n    getWeights() {\n        const weights = [];\n        for (const point of this._controlPoints) {\n            weights.push(point.weight);\n        }\n        return weights;\n    }\n}\n```",
