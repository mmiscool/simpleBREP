      "content": "# NURBS Library Development Plan\n\n## Overview\nThe NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) library aims to provide functionalities for evaluating NURBS curves and surfaces, as well as performing intersection operations between NURBS curves and surfaces. This library will be implemented in C++ and will utilize mathematical libraries like Eigen for linear algebra operations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n1. **NURBS Curve Evaluation**\n   - Implement a function to evaluate the value of a NURBS curve at a given parameter (t).\n   - The function should take input parameters: knot vector, control points, and the evaluation parameter (t).\n2. **NURBS Surface Evaluation**\n   - Implement a function to evaluate the value of a NURBS surface at given u and v parameters.\n   - The function should take input parameters: knot vectors for u and v directions, control points, and the evaluation parameters (u and v).\n3. **Intersection Operations**\n   - Develop an algorithm to compute intersections between two NURBS curves.\n   - Develop an algorithm to compute intersections between a NURBS curve and a NURBS surface.\n4. **Input Validation**\n   - Ensure input data is validated for correctness, such as checking for consistent knot vector lengths, valid control points, etc.\n5. **Exception Handling**\n   - Implement exception handling mechanisms to manage potential errors during execution, like division by zero or invalid input parameters.\n6. **Performance Optimization**\n   - Optimize algorithms for efficiency, especially in the intersection computation operations, considering caching computed results where appropriate.\n7. **Documentation and Testing**\n   - Provide comprehensive documentation detailing usage, API reference, and implementation details of the library.\n   - Implement unit tests to ensure correctness across various scenarios and edge cases.\n\n### Non-functional Requirements\n1. **Portability**\n   - The library should be portable across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).\n2. **Compatibility**\n   - Ensure compatibility with popular C++ standards (C++11, C++14, or later) and widely used compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC).\n3. **Ease of Integration**\n   - Provide clear instructions for integrating the library into other projects, including build system setup (CMakeLists.txt) and dependency management.\n4. **Performance**\n   - Optimize performance to handle large datasets efficiently, focusing on reducing computational complexity where possible.\n5. **Code Quality**\n   - Adhere to coding standards and best practices for maintainability and readability.\n   - Implement clear, modular designs that facilitate future enhancements or modifications.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Eigen: A C++ template library for linear algebra, matrix and vector operations, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.\n- GMP/MPIR (for arbitrary precision arithmetic): To handle high-precision calculations required in NURBS evaluations.\n\n## Design Considerations\n1. **Data Structures**\n   - Use appropriate data structures to represent knot vectors, control points, and other necessary components for efficient access and manipulation.\n   - Opt for dynamic memory allocation for flexibility in handling varying sizes of input data.\n2. **Evaluation Algorithms**\n   - Implement De Boor's algorithm or similar for NURBS curve evaluation due to its efficiency and numerical stability.\n   - For surface evaluations, consider using a product Bézier formulation for simpler handling of basis functions.\n3. **Intersection Algorithms**\n   - Use analytical methods where possible (e.g., for intersections with planes) or numerically solve the resulting system of equations for more complex intersection scenarios.\n4. **Optimization Strategies**\n   - Utilize spatial partitioning techniques, such as bounding volume hierarchies (BVH), to reduce the number of intersection tests in complex scenes.\n   - Cache intermediate results where appropriate to avoid redundant calculations during intersections or evaluations.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n- Support for Bézier and B-spline curves and surfaces.\n- Implement NURBS subdivision schemes for smooth curve/surface refinement.\n- Integration with rendering libraries (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX) for visualization purposes.\n\nThis plan outlines the key components required to build a comprehensive NURBS library with evaluation capabilities and intersection support. It emphasizes performance optimization, code quality, and ease of integration, ensuring that the resulting system is robust, efficient, and adaptable to future enhancements."
