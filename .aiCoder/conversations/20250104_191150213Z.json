      "content": "# NURBS Library Requirements for BREP Kernel\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive requirements for a NURBS library designed to be integrated into a Boundary Representation (BREP) kernel.  The library will support curve and surface representations, manipulation, and analysis necessary for solid modeling operations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n- **Knot Vector:** A non-decreasing sequence of real numbers defining the parameter domain of a NURBS curve or surface.\n- **Control Points:** Points in space that influence the shape of the NURBS curve or surface.  These will be represented using homogenous coordinates.\n- **Weights:**  Associated with each control point, influencing the curve's or surface's shape and allowing for conics and other rational curves/surfaces.\n- **Degree:** The degree of the polynomial basis functions used to define the NURBS.\n- **Dimension:** The spatial dimension of the control points (2D or 3D).  The library will primarily focus on 3D.\n- **De Boor Algorithm:**  The primary algorithm for NURBS curve and surface evaluation.\n- **Cox-de Boor Recursion Formula:** Used for efficient computation of B-spline basis functions within the De Boor algorithm.\n- **Newton-Raphson Method:** Used for iterative root finding in intersection algorithms.\n- **Curve/Surface Subdivision:**  Methods to recursively subdivide NURBS entities for improved accuracy and efficiency in certain operations.\n\n## Classes\n\n### 1. `NurbsCurve`\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - `knotVector` (Array of Numbers):  The knot vector.\n    - `controlPoints` (Array of Arrays of Numbers): Homogenous control points (x, y, z, weight).\n    - `degree` (Number):  Degree of the curve.\n    - `dimension` (Number): Dimensionality of the curve (3 for 3D).\n\n- **Methods:**\n    - `constructor(knotVector, controlPoints, degree)`: Initializes a `NurbsCurve` instance with input validation.\n    - `evaluate(u)`: Evaluates the curve at parameter `u` using the De Boor algorithm.

The choices of specific algorithms can be adapted based on performance requirements and available computational resources.",
