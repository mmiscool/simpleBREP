The `basisFunction` method is used to calculate these basis functions.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the knot vector is provided and properly formatted according to NURBS curve specifications. Additionally, this code does not include any error checking or input validation for simplicity. In a real-world application, it's essential to validate inputs, handle edge cases, and add error handling as necessary."

The first and only tool that is using ASTs to perform surgical changes to existing code files with out mangling the code.\n\n## aiCoder\n\n\n\n**Harness AI to Craft Your JavaScript Libraries with Ease!**\n\nTired of manually copying and pasting code snippets from ChatGPT into your editor? **aiCoder** is your solution, streamlining the coding process with an AI-powered assistant.\n\nWith **aiCoder** as your coding co-pilot, you can simplify development, refine your code, and bring ideas to life through natural language interactions. It intelligently merges AI-suggested changes into your existing codeâ€”without disrupting what youâ€™ve already built.\n\nThe magic lies in aiCoderâ€™s advanced merging logic, which keeps your original code intact while integrating new snippets precisely and reliably.\n\n[![NEW UI](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/raw/master/images/aiCoder.gif)](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/blob/master/images/aiCoder.gif)\n\n[Slide Deck discussing the AST approach to merging snippets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xdX09ELgW7lMU1E9KWIrpibUYVT1wdaiSvUhFhAT7EI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Code manipulator source file](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/blob/master/src/intelligentMerge.js)\n\n [![Star History Chart](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4afdb58c2e63c3ad3ad961efa5aa20f12a4fb122bd23ff32bdb0fcc379ccd623/68747470733a2f2f6170692e737461722d686973746f72792e636f6d2f7376673f7265706f733d6d6d6973636f6f6c2f6169436f64657226747970653d44617465)](https://star-history.com/#mmiscool/aiCoder&Date) \n\n## Purpose and Benefits\n\n\n\n**aiCoder** is designed to enhance your coding experience by leveraging the power of AI. It helps you:\n\n-   Save time by automating repetitive coding tasks.\n-   Improve code quality with intelligent suggestions.\n-   Focus on higher-level design and problem-solving.\n-   Seamlessly integrate new features and improvements into your existing codebase.\n\n## UNSTABLE\n\n\n\n**Note:** This project is under rapid development. Settings and prompt files may need to be recreated as updates are released, since more settings and file renames are on the horizon.\n\n## Standard Workflow\n\n\n\n1.  Run `aiCoder` in your projectâ€™s directory.\n2.  Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to access the web UI.\n3.  Use **New Plan Chat** to discuss and define your project requirements, then save the plan. The saved plan guides future implementations.\n4.  Open the **Files** tab to select the target file you want to modify.\n5.  Start a **New Chat** with the selected file.\n6.  Request code changes using natural language prompts.\n7.  Review the suggested snippets and click **ðŸ¤–âœŽâš¡** to automatically merge them into the file.\n\n## Installation\n\n\n\nInstallation instructions provided for linux.\n\n### From NPM\n\n\n\n### From Source\n\n\n\n1.  Clone this repository and navigate to the cloned directory.\n2.  Run:\n    \n    ```\n    cd aiCoder\n    npm install && npm install -g .\n    \n    ```\n    \n\nAfter installation, youâ€™re all set! Just run the `aiCoder` or the much short `a` command in any project directory.\n\nInstalling Ollama allows you to use local LLMs. On linux you can run `aiCoder -setup` to automatically install ollama and pull the default model or manually install it with the following commands:\n\n```\n# Install Ollama \ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n\n# Pull the preferred model\nollama pull granite3-dense\n\n```\n\nYou can find and install additional models to test with [https://ollama.com/search](https://ollama.com/search)\n\n## Usage\n\n\n\nLaunch `aiCoder` from within your project folder:\n\n```\ncd myProjectFolder\naicoder\n\n```\n\nThen open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to begin.\n\nTo run on a different port use `aicoder -p 3001`\n\n## Chat Interface\n\n\n\n[![NEW UI](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/raw/master/images/CHAT.png)](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/blob/master/images/CHAT.png)\n\n## aiCoder provides two difrent specialized chat modes:\n\n\n\n## New Chat\n\n\n\nUse **New Chat** to interactively modify a selected file. Before starting a conversation, be sure to choose a file from the **Files** tab. The LLM uses a system prompt specifying the snippet format. Correctly formatted snippets can be merged automatically, updating existing functions or class methods without disturbing the rest of the code.\n\n## New Plan Chat\n\n\n\nUse **New Plan Chat** to refine the project plan document. This plan, combined with the default system prompts, guides the LLM during regular chats.  \nBegin by describing your project goals. You can ask the LLM to produce a detailed outline of all the necessary classes and methods, then save this plan.\n\n## Tools\n\n\n\n[![NEW TOOLS](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/raw/master/images/TOOLS.png)](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/blob/master/images/TOOLS.png)\n\n## Methods List\n\n\n\nDisplays all detected methods.\n\n-   **Green** methods: Implemented methods with code.\n-   **Red** methods: Stubs that need implementation.\n\nClicking on a method passes it into a new chat, allowing you to modify or implement it.\n\n## Stubs List\n\n\n\nShows only stub methods, making it easy to identify and implement missing functionality.\n\n## Merge and Format\n\n\n\nIf youâ€™re using ChatGPT or another external LLM, you can copy and paste suggested snippets to the end of the file. They must follow the guidelines in `snippet_production_prompt.md` for automatic merging.\n\n## Prepend Class Structure\n\n\n\nAdds a skeleton of all existing classes and methods to the top of the file. You can reorder classes and methods here. After adjusting the structure, run **Merge and Format** to clean up and integrate the changes into the stubs.\n\n## Project Settings\n\n\n\nProject-specific settings are stored in `./.aiCoder/`. This folder includes backups of modified files stored in `./.aiCoder/backups/`.\n\nYou can customize system prompts for your project in the `./aiCoder/` folder. Access these settings in your IDE or from the **Project Settings** tab.\n\n## default\\_plan\\_prompt\n\n\n\nDescribes your project, goals, and requirements. Edit it directly, or use **New Plan Chat** to interactively refine it.\n\n## default\\_system\\_prompt\n\n\n\nShapes the LLMâ€™s personality and behavior. If you break it, donâ€™t worryâ€”delete it and restart aiCoder to restore defaults. If you find improvements, consider opening an issue with your suggested changes.\n\n## snippet\\_production\\_prompt\n\n\n\nInstructs the LLM on how to format code snippets for seamless merging.  \n**All snippets must conform to the following format:**\n\n```\nclass exampleClass {\n   // ... existing methods\n   exampleMethod(){\n      //example code\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\n## LLM Settings\n\n\n\n[![NEW LLM SETTINGS](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/raw/master/images/SETTINGS.png)](https://github.com/mmiscool/aiCoder/blob/master/images/SETTINGS.png)\n\nBefore using aiCoder, configure your LLM provider and model. After providing an API key, you can view available models.\n\n## Choosing an LLM Provider\n\n\n\n-   OpenAIâ€™s `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4o` models work well.\n-   Anthropicsâ€™s `claude-3-5-haiku` is an option.\n-   Groq is less tested and has a smaller context window.\n-   Ollama runs locally but may be slower. Its `granite3-dense:8b` model works well enough, though sometimes requires additional prompting to get properly formatted snippets.\n\n## Backup Functionality\n\n\n\nEvery time aiCoder modifies a file, it creates a backup in `./.aiCoder/backups/`, preserving your original code with timestamped filenames.\n\n## âœ… Current State of the Project\n\n\n\n**Implemented:**\n\n-   Automatic merging of multiple class/function definitions into a single source structure.\n-   Ability to prompt for modifications to a single JS file.\n-   Automatic backups before modification.\n-   Code snippet extraction from LLM responses and a workflow to accept/reject on a per-snippet basis.\n-   Custom prompt manager for reusable prompts.\n-   Support for various LLM providers.\n-   Automatic setup on first use (provider selection, API key, model choice).\n-   NPM packaging.\n-   Automatic generation of stub methods and their code.\n\n**To Do:**\n\n-   Support multiple files simultaneously.\n-   Allow the LLM to suggest adding NPM packages.\n-   Add support for HTML, CSS, and MD files by parsing them to ASTs and merging changes.\n-   Preserve comments during merges.\n\n## ðŸŒŒ Looking Ahead\n\n\n\naiCoder is more than a toolâ€”itâ€™s your personal AI development partner. By making coding smarter, faster, and more fluid, aiCoder helps you unlock new creative possibilities.\n\nEmbark on your journey with aiCoder today, and experience a whole new world of coding! ðŸŒŸ\n\n## FAQs\n\n\n\n1.  **How do I reset my settings?**\n    -   Delete the `./.aiCoder/` folder and restart aiCoder. This will recreate the default settings and prompts.\n2.  **Can I use aiCoder with other programming languages?**\n    -   Currently, aiCoder is optimized for JavaScript. Support for other languages is planned for future releases.\n3.  **How do I update aiCoder?**\n    -   If installed via npm, run `npm update aicodertool -g`. If installed from source, pull the latest changes from the repository and reinstall."
