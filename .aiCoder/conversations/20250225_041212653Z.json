      "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write the basisFunction method for the NurbsSurface class. Hmm, I remember that NURBS surfaces use B-spline basis functions. So the basisFunction method probably computes the value of a specific basis function given parameters like index, degree, and knots.\n\nWait, the method is called basisFunction and takes i, degree, u, and knots. So I need to calculate the ith basis function of degree 'degree' evaluated at parameter 'u' with the given 'knots'.\n\nI think the B-spline basis functions are computed recursively. The Cox-de Boor recursion formula comes to mind. For degree 0, it's just 1 if u is between the ith and i+1th knots, else 0. For higher degrees, it's a weighted average based on the adjacent knots.\n\nSo the function should handle the base case first. If degree is 0, check if u is between knots[i] and knots[i+1]. If yes, return 1, else 0.\n\nFor higher degrees, I'll need to compute the left and right fractions. The left fraction is (u - knots[i]) / (knots[i + degree] - knots[i]). The right fraction is (knots[i + degree + 1] - u) / (knots[i + degree + 1] - knots[i + 1]).\n\nThen, the basis function is the left fraction multiplied by the basis function of degree-1 at i, plus the right fraction multiplied by the basis function of degree-1 at i+1.\n\nWait, but in code, how do I handle the recursion? I'll need to call basisFunction again with degree-1. But I should make sure that the parameters are correct each time.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the knots correctly. The knots array should have enough elements. For a degree d, each basis function i has support from knots[i] to knots[i + d + 1]. So I need to make sure that the knots array is properly set up.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if degree is 0. If yes, return 1 if u is between knots[i] and knots[i+1], else 0.\n2. If degree > 0, compute the left and right fractions.\n3. Recursively compute the basis functions for degree-1 at i and i+1.\n4. Combine them using the fractions and return the result.\n\nWait, but in the code, the knots array is passed as an argument. So each recursive call will use the same knots array. That should be fine.\n\nLet me think about the base case. For degree 0, the function is 1 between knots[i] and knots[i+1]. So if u is >= knots[i] and < knots[i+1], return 1. Else, 0.\n\nFor the recursive step, compute the denominators for the left and right fractions. If the denominator is zero, that means the knot span is zero, so the fraction is zero. Otherwise, compute the fraction.\n\nThen, the basis function is (leftFraction * basisFunction(i, degree-1, u, knots)) + (rightFraction * basisFunction(i+1, degree-1, u, knots)).\n\nWait, but in the code, the function is part of the NurbsSurface class, so it's a method. So the code would be inside the class.\n\nI should also make sure that the knots array is correctly indexed. For example, for degree d, the number of knots should be i + d + 1. So I need to ensure that the knots array is long enough to avoid index errors.\n\nBut perhaps that's handled elsewhere, and this function assumes valid knots.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code would look something like:\n\nclass NurbsSurface {\n    basisFunction(i, degree, u, knots) {\n        if (degree === 0) {\n            return (u >= knots[i] && u < knots[i + 1]) ? 1 : 0;\n        } else {\n            const denominatorLeft = knots[i + degree] - knots[i];\n            const denominatorRight = knots[i + degree + 1] - knots[i + 1];\n            \n            let leftFraction, rightFraction;\n            \n            if (denominatorLeft === 0) {\n                leftFraction = 0;\n            } else {\n                leftFraction = (u - knots[i]) / denominatorLeft;\n            }\n            \n            if (denominatorRight === 0) {\n                rightFraction = 0;\n            } else {\n                rightFraction = (knots[i + degree + 1] - u) / denominatorRight;\n            }\n            \n            const basisLeft = this.basisFunction(i, degree - 1, u, knots);\n            const basisRight = this.basisFunction(i + 1, degree - 1, u, knots);\n            \n            return leftFraction * basisLeft + rightFraction * basisRight;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the knots array is passed as a parameter. So each recursive call uses the same knots array, which is correct.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like when u is exactly at a knot. For degree 0, it's 1 if u is >= knots[i] and < knots[i+1]. So if u equals knots[i+1], it's 0. That's correct because the basis function is right-continuous.\n\nFor higher degrees, the recursion should handle it correctly.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So the code should implement the Cox-de Boor recursion as outlined.\n</think>\n\nHere's the implementation of the `basisFunction` method in the `NurbsSurface` class using the Cox-de Boor recursion formula for B-spline basis functions:\n\n```\nclass NurbsSurface {\n    basisFunction(i, degree, u, knots) {\n        if (degree === 0) {\n            return (u >= knots[i] && u < knots[i + 1]) ? 1 : 0;\n        } else {\n            const d = degree;\n            const leftDenominator = knots[i + d] - knots[i];\n            const rightDenominator = knots[i + d + 1] - knots[i + 1];\n            \n            let leftFraction = 0;\n            if (leftDenominator !== 0) {\n                leftFraction = (u - knots[i]) / leftDenominator;\n            }\n            \n            let rightFraction = 0;\n            if (rightDenominator !== 0) {\n                rightFraction = (knots[i + d + 1] - u) / rightDenominator;\n            }\n            \n            const basisLeft = this.basisFunction(i, d - 1, u, knots);\n            const basisRight = this.basisFunction(i + 1, d - 1, u, knots);\n            \n            return leftFraction * basisLeft + rightFraction * basisRight;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",

  "title": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to write the basisFunction method in the NurbsSurface class. I'm not super familiar with NURBS surfaces, but I know they have something to do with B-spline basis functions. Let me start by recalling what a NURBS surface is. NURBS stands for Non-uniform Rational B-Spline. It's a mathematical model used in computer graphics and engineering to represent curves and surfaces. The basis functions are essential because they define the shape of the surface.\n\nSo, the basisFunction method probably computes the value of a specific basis function at a given parameter value. The parameters I have are i, degree, u, and knots. I think i is the index of the basis function, degree is the order of the polynomial, u is the parameter value where we want to evaluate the basis function, and knots is the array of knot values.\n\nI remember that B-spline basis functions are defined recursively using the Cox-de Boor algorithm. For degree 0, it's just a step functionâ€”1 if u is within the interval defined by the knot, 0 otherwise. For higher degrees, each basis function is a linear combination of two lower-degree basis functions, scaled by the knot spans.\n\nLet me think about the base case first. If the degree is 0, then the basis function is 1 if u is between knots[i] and knots[i+1], else 0. That seems straightforward.\n\nFor higher degrees, I need to compute the left and right fractions based on the knot spans. The left fraction is (u - knots[i]) / (knots[i + degree] - knots[i]), and the right fraction is (knots[i + degree + 1] - u) / (knots[i + degree + 1] - knots[i + 1]). Then, the basis function is the sum of the left fraction times the basis function of degree-1 at i and the right fraction times the basis function of degree-1 at i+1.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I'm handling the cases where the denominators are zero to avoid division by zero errors. Maybe I should set the fractions to zero in those cases.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. If degree is 0:\n   - Return 1 if u is in [knots[i], knots[i+1])\n   - Else return 0\n2. Else:\n   - Compute leftDenominator = knots[i + degree] - knots[i]\n   - Compute rightDenominator = knots[i + degree + 1] - knots[i + 1]\n   - If leftDenominator is zero, set leftFraction to 0, else compute (u - knots[i]) / leftDenominator\n   - Similarly for rightFraction\n   - Recursively compute basisFunction for degree-1 at i and i+1\n   - Return leftFraction * basisLeft + rightFraction * basisRight\n\nI think that covers the general case. Now, I need to translate this into JavaScript code within the NurbsSurface class. I'll have to make sure the method is correctly defined and handles all edge cases, especially the base case and avoiding division by zero.\n\nLet me also consider some test cases to verify. For example, if degree is 1, then it's a linear B-spline. The basis functions should be triangles between consecutive knots. For higher degrees, the basis functions should be smoother.\n\nI should also make sure that the knots array is correctly indexed and that i + degree + 1 doesn't exceed the length of the knots array. But I guess that's handled by the calling code.\n\nAlright, I think I have a good plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo implement the `basisFunction` method in the `NurbsSurface` class, we follow the Cox-de Boor recursion formula for B-spline basis functions. This method computes the value of a specific basis function at a given parameter value, essential for constructing NURBS surfaces.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Case (Degree 0):** For degree 0, the basis function is 1 if the parameter `u` lies within the interval defined by `knots[i]` and `knots[i+1]`, otherwise 0.\n2. **Recursive Case (Degree > 0):** For higher degrees, compute the left and right fractions based on the knot spans. Use these fractions to weight the recursive calls to the basis functions of degree-1 at indices `i` and `i+1`.\n3. **Avoid Division by Zero:** Ensure that divisions by zero are handled gracefully by setting the corresponding fractions to zero when denominators are zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript\nclass NurbsSurface {\n    basisFunction(i, degree, u, knots) {\n        if (degree === 0) {\n            return (u >= knots[i] && u < knots[i + 1]) ? 1 : 0;\n        } else {\n            const d = degree;\n            const leftDenominator = knots[i + d] - knots[i];\n            const rightDenominator = knots[i + d + 1] - knots[i + 1];\n            \n            let leftFraction = 0;\n            if (leftDenominator !== 0) {\n                leftFraction = (u - knots[i]) / leftDenominator;\n            }\n            \n            let rightFraction = 0;\n            if (rightDenominator !== 0) {\n                rightFraction = (knots[i + d + 1] - u) / rightDenominator;\n            }\n            \n            const basisLeft = this.basisFunction(i, d - 1, u, knots);\n            const basisRight = this.basisFunction(i + 1, d - 1, u, knots);\n            \n            return leftFraction * basisLeft + rightFraction * basisRight;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Case Handling:** Directly returns 1 or 0 based on the position of `u` within the knot interval for degree 0.\n- **Recursive Calculation:** For higher degrees, computes the contributions from adjacent basis functions, weighted by the parameter `u`'s position relative to the knots.\n- **Edge Cases:** Safeguards against division by zero by setting fractions to zero when denominators are zero, ensuring numerical stability.\n\nThis implementation efficiently computes the basis function values using recursion, adhering to the mathematical definition of B-spline basis functions.",
