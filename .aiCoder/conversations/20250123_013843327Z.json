Syntactic Analysis (Parsing) — Esprima master documentation\n\nThe main use case of Esprima is to parse a JavaScript program. This is also known as _[syntactic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing)_.\n\nEsprima parser takes a string representing a valid JavaScript program and produces a [syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), an ordered tree that describes the syntactic structure of the program. The resulting syntax tree is useful for various purposes, from [program transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_transformation) to [static program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis).\n\nThe interface of the `parseScript`/`parseModule` function is as follows:\n\n```\nesprima.parseScript(input, config, delegate)\nesprima.parseModule(input, config, delegate)\n\n```\n\nwhere\n\n-   `input` is the string representing the program to be parsed\n-   `config` is an object used to customize the parsing behavior (optional)\n-   `delegate` is a callback function invoked for every single node (optional)\n\nThe `input` argument is mandatory. Its type must be a string, otherwise the parsing behavior is not determined. The other two arguments, `config` and `delegate`, are optional.\n\nThe object returned by the `parseScript`/`parseModule` function is the [syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), following the format described in details in [Appendix A. Syntax Tree Format](https://docs.esprima.org/en/latest/syntax-tree-format.html).\n\nThe description of various parsing configuration is summarized in the following table:\n\n| Name | Type | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| jsx | Boolean | false | Support JSX syntax |\n| range | Boolean | false | Annotate each node with its index-based location |\n| loc | Boolean | false | Annotate each node with its column and row-based location |\n| tolerant | Boolean | false | Tolerate a few cases of syntax errors |\n| tokens | Boolean | false | Collect every token |\n| comment | Boolean | false | Collect every line and block comment |\n\n![Runkit with Esprima parse](https://docs.esprima.org/en/latest/_images/runkit-parse.png)\n\nThe previous chapter, [Getting Started](https://docs.esprima.org/en/latest/getting-started.html), already demonstrates the simplest possible example of using Esprima parser. To use it as the basis for further experiments, use Runkit and tweak the existing demo notebook: [runkit.com/ariya/esprima-parse-demo](https://runkit.com/ariya/esprima-parse-demo).\n\n## Distinguishing a Script and a Module[¶](#distinguishing-a-script-and-a-module \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nWith ES2015 and later, a JavaScript program can be either [a script or a module](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules). It is a very important distinction, a parser such as Esprima needs to know the type of the source to be able to analyze its syntax correctly. This is achieved by choosing `parseScript` function to parse a script and `parseModule` function to parse a module.\n\nAn example of parsing a script:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('answer = 42');\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body: [ ExpressionStatement { type: 'ExpressionStatement', expression: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'script' }\n\n```\n\nAn example of parsing a module:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseModule('import { sqrt } from \"math.js\"');\nModule {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ ImportDeclaration {\n       type: 'ImportDeclaration',\n       specifiers: [Object],\n       source: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'module' }\n\n```\n\nFailing to choose the correct parsing function can lead to a _mistaken_ observation that Esprima does not support a certain syntax. Take a look at this example:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('export const answer = 42');\nError: Line 1: Unexpected token\n\n```\n\nInstead of producing the syntax tree, the parser throws an exception. This is the correct behavior, an `export` statement can only be part of a module, not a script. Thus, the parser properly determines that such a source program is invalid.\n\n_Note_: In the previous versions (Esprima <= 3.1), there was a single parsing function, `parse`. To distinguish between parsing a script and a module, the `sourceType` property in the configuration object needs to be specified, either as `\"script\"` (also the default value) or `\"module\"`. While this `parse` function is still supported in Esprima 4 for API backward compatibility, its usage is highly discouraged and the support for it may be removed in a future version.\n\n## JSX Syntax Support[¶](#jsx-syntax-support \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\n[JSX](http://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is a syntax extension to JavaScript, popularly known to build web applications using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). JSX is not part of any [official ECMAScript specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). Application code using JSX is typically preprocessed first into standard JavaScript.\n\nEsprima parser fully understands JSX syntax when `jsx` flag in the parsing configuration object is set to true, as illustrated in the following example:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('var el= <title>${product}</title>', { jsx: true });\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ VariableDeclaration {\n       type: 'VariableDeclaration',\n       declarations: [Object],\n       kind: 'var' } ],\n  sourceType: 'script' }\n\n```\n\n## Browser Compatibility[¶](#browser-compatibility \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nIn a certain specific case, Esprima parser _intentionally_ does not throw an exception (indicating a syntax error) although the input being parsed is not valid. This is to achieve an implementation compatibility with major web browsers. For further details, refer to the official [ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), Section B.3.3 on **Block-Level Function Declarations Web Legacy Compatibility Semantics**:\n\n> Prior to ECMAScript 2015, the ECMAScript specification did not define the occurrence of a _FunctionDeclaration_ as an element of a _Block_ statement’s _StatementList_. However, support for that form of _FunctionDeclaration_ was an allowable extension and most browser-hosted ECMAScript implementations permitted them.\n\nThis is illustrated in the following example:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('if (x) function y() {}')\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ IfStatement {\n       type: 'IfStatement',\n       test: [Object],\n       consequent: [Object],\n       alternate: null } ],\n  sourceType: 'script' }\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, Esprima parser returns a syntax tree for the code (it does not throw an exception) even though the input is invalid according to the specification, i.e. declaring a function inside the block of an If statement is not possible. In this case, the behavior of Esprima is the same as the popular web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and many others.\n\n## Tolerant Mode[¶](#tolerant-mode \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nWhen Esprima parser is given an input that does not represent a valid JavaScript program, it throws an exception. With the tolerant mode however, the parser _may_ choose to continue parsing and produce a syntax tree. This is best demonstrated with an example.\n\nConsider the following parsing session. The exception is expected, since a `with` statement is not permitted in strict mode.\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('\"use strict\"; with (x) {}')\nError: Line 1: Strict mode code may not include a with statement\n\n```\n\nIf the tolerant mode is activated by setting the `tolerant` flag to true in the parsing configuration, the parser behaves differently:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('\"use strict\"; with (x) {}', { tolerant: true })\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ Directive {\n       type: 'ExpressionStatement',\n       expression: [Object],\n       directive: 'use strict' },\n     WithStatement { type: 'WithStatement', object: [Object], body: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'script',\n  errors:\n   [ { Error: Line 1: Strict mode code may not include a with statement\n       index: 13,\n       lineNumber: 1,\n       description: 'Strict mode code may not include a with statement' } ] }\n\n```\n\nIn the above case, the parser does not throw an exception and it still returns a syntax tree. However, it also adds a new array named `errors`, it contains each and every syntax error that the parser manages to tolerate without causing it to stop right away. Each entry in the `errors` has the detailed information regarding the error, including the description and the location.\n\nNote that the tolerant mode is intended to deal with very few types of syntax errors. It is unable to robustly handle every possible invalid program.\n\n## Regular Expression Literals[¶](#regular-expression-literals \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nEsprima does not implement logic to fully parse ECMAScript regular expressions. Instead, it delegates this responsibility to the JavaScript engine in which it executed (i.e. via the built-in `RegExp` function). This approach means that Esprima may respond to the same input differently depending on the JavaScript engine in use. It will exhibit the same bugs and features of the regular expression parser in the host environment.\n\n## Node Location[¶](#node-location \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nBy default, Esprima parser produces an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). For some use cases, this abstract syntax tree is not sufficient. For instance, having the location information of each node is necessary in a few cases of static analysis, e.g. to give a meaningful feedback to the user.\n\nTo have each node carries some additional properties indicating its location, the parser must be invoked by specifying the flags, `range` or `loc` or both of them, in the parsing configuration.\n\nSetting the `range` flag to true adds a new property, `range`, to each node. It is an array of two elements, each indicating the zero-based index of the starting and end location (exclusive) of the node. A simple example follows:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('answer = 42', { range: true })\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ ExpressionStatement {\n       type: 'ExpressionStatement',\n       expression: [Object],\n       range: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'script',\n  range: [ 0, 11 ] }\n\n```\n\nThe top-level _Program_ node has the range \\[0, 11\\]. This indicates that the program starts from the zeroth character and finishes before the 11th character.\n\nA subsequent example to inspect the numeric literal 42 on the right side of the assignment:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> var program = esprima.parseScript('answer = 42', { range: true })\n> program.body[0].expression.right\nLiteral { type: 'Literal', value: 42, raw: '42', range: [ 9, 11 ] }\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, the location of the _Literal_ node is determined to be \\[9, 11\\]. In other words, the ninth and the tenth characters (the eleventh is excluded) of the source correspond to the numeric literal `42`.\n\nSetting the `loc` flag to true adds a new property, `loc`, to each node. It is a object that contains the line number and column number of the starting and end location (exclusive) of the node. It is illustrated in this example:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('answer = 42', { loc: true })\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ ExpressionStatement {\n       type: 'ExpressionStatement',\n       expression: [Object],\n       loc: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'script',\n  loc: { start: { line: 1, column: 0 }, end: { line: 1, column: 11 } } }\n\n```\n\nNote that the line number is _one-based_ while the column number is _zero-based_.\n\nIt is possible to set both `range` and `loc` to true, thereby giving each token the most complete location information.\n\n## Handling Hashbang/Shebang[¶](#handling-hashbang-shebang \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nIn a Unix environment, a shell script often has its first line marked by a hashbang or a shebang, `#!`. A common example is a utility intended to be executed by Node.js, which may look like the following:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconsole.log('Hello from Node.js!');\n\n```\n\nIf Esprima parser is being used to process the content of the above file, the parser will throw an exception. This is because that hashbang is not valid in JavaScript. A quick Node.js REPL session to illustrate the point:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> var src = ['#!/usr/bin/env node', 'answer = 42'].join('\\n')\n> esprima.parseScript(src)\nError: Line 1: Unexpected token ILLEGAL\n\n```\n\nThe workaround for this problem is to remove the first line completely before passing it to the parser. One way to do that is to use a regular expression, as shown below:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> var src = ['#!/usr/bin/env node', 'answer = 42'].join('\\n')\n> src = src.replace(/^#!(.*\\n)/, '')\n'answer = 42'\n> esprima.parseScript(src)\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body: [ ExpressionStatement { type: 'ExpressionStatement', expression: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'script' }\n\n```\n\nNote that the above approach will shorten the source string. If the string length needs to be preserved, e.g. to facilitate an exact location mapping to the original version, then a series of whitespaces need to be padded to the beginning. A modified approach looks like the following:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> var src = ['#!/usr/bin/env node', 'answer = 42'].join('\\n')\n> src = src.replace(/(^#!.*)/, function(m) { return Array(m.length + 1).join(' ') });\n> esprima.parseScript(src, { range: true })\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ ExpressionStatement {\n       type: 'ExpressionStatement',\n       expression: [Object],\n       range: [Object] } ],\n  sourceType: 'script',\n  range: [ 15, 26 ] }\n\n```\n\n## Token Collection[¶](#token-collection \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nWhen Esprima parser is performing the syntactical analysis, first it needs to break down the source into a series of tokens. By default, the tokens are not stored as part of the parsing result. It is possible to keep the tokens found during the parsing by setting the `tokens` flag in the configuration object to true. Take a look at this example:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> esprima.parseScript('const answer = 42', { tokens: true })\nScript {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body:\n   [ VariableDeclaration {\n       type: 'VariableDeclaration',\n       declarations: [Object],\n       kind: 'const' } ],\n  sourceType: 'script',\n  tokens:\n   [ { type: 'Keyword', value: 'const' },\n     { type: 'Identifier', value: 'answer' },\n     { type: 'Punctuator', value: '=' },\n     { type: 'Numeric', value: '42' } ] }\n\n```\n\nThe output of the parser now contains an additional property, an array named `tokens`. Every element in this array is the token found during the parsing process. For each token, the `type` property is a string indicating the type of the token and the `value` property stores the corresponding the _lexeme_, i.e. a string of characters which forms a syntactic unit.\n\nThe token also contains its location, if the parsing configuration has the flag `range` or `loc` (or both), as shown in the following example:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var esprima = require('esprima')\n> var output = esprima.parseScript('const answer = 42', { tokens: true, range: true })\n> output.tokens\n[ { type: 'Keyword', value: 'const', range: [ 0, 5 ] },\n  { type: 'Identifier', value: 'answer', range: [ 6, 12 ] },\n  { type: 'Punctuator', value: '=', range: [ 13, 14 ] },\n  { type: 'Numeric', value: '42', range: [ 15, 17 ] } ]\n\n```\n\nTo tokenize a program without parsing it at all, refer to [Chapter 3. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)](https://docs.esprima.org/en/latest/syntactic-analysis.html).\n\n## Syntax Delegate[¶](#syntax-delegate \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nThe last argument in the `parseScript`/`parseModule` function is a delegate, a callback function invoked for each syntax node (as the node is constructed) with two arguments, the node object itself and the node metadata. The metadata contains the start and end location of the node.\n\nThe shortest Node.js script that illustrates the delegate is the following:\n\n```\nvar esprima = require('esprima');\nesprima.parseScript('answer = 42', {}, function (node) {\n    console.log(node.type);\n});\n\n```\n\nIf the script is called `delegate.js`, running it with Node.js gives the output:\n\n```\n$ node delegate.js\nIdentifier\nLiteral\nAssignmentExpression\nExpressionStatement\nProgram\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, the callback function only does one simple thing: printing the type of the node. The first two calls are with the deepest nodes (which are also leaves), an _Identifier_ node representing `answer` and a _Literal_ node for `42`. The next is with an _AssignmentExpression_ node that combines the previous two nodes (`answer = 42`). It is then followed by the only statement in the code fragment, an _ExpressionStatement_ node. The last one, as with every syntax tree, is always the top-level _Program_ node.\n\nThe order of the nodes being passed as the argument for the callback function resembles a tree traversal using the [depth-first algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).\n\nIf each single-line and multi-line comment must be passed to the callback function as well, the `comment` flag in the parsing configuration needs to be true. A modified `delegate.js` and its new result (note the addition of _LineComment_ node type):\n\n```\n$ cat delegate.js\nvar esprima = require('esprima');\nesprima.parseScript('answer = 42 // FIXME', { comment: true }, function (node) {\n    console.log(node.type);\n});\n\n$ node delegate.js\nIdentifier\nLineComment\nLiteral\nAssignmentExpression\nExpressionStatement\nProgram\n\n```\n\nThe second argument passed to the callback function, the metadata, can be used to locate the node. It is illustrated in the following example:\n\n```\n$ cat delegate.js\nvar esprima = require('esprima');\nesprima.parseScript('answer = 42', {}, function (node, metadata) {\n    console.log(node.type, metadata);\n});\n\n$ node delegate.js\nIdentifier { start: { line: 1, column: 0, offset: 0 },\n  end: { line: 1, column: 6, offset: 6 } }\nLiteral { start: { line: 1, column: 9, offset: 9 },\n  end: { line: 1, column: 11, offset: 11 } }\nAssignmentExpression { start: { line: 1, column: 0, offset: 0 },\n  end: { line: 1, column: 11, offset: 11 } }\nExpressionStatement { start: { line: 1, column: 0, offset: 0 },\n  end: { line: 1, column: 11, offset: 11 } }\nProgram { start: { line: 1, column: 0, offset: 0 },\n  end: { line: 1, column: 11, offset: 11 } }\n\n```\n\n## Example: console Calls Removal[¶](#example-console-calls-removal \"Permalink to this headline\")\n\nThe following Node.js script demonstrates the use of Esprima parser to remove every single expression that represents a `console` call. The script accepts the input from `stdin` and displays the result to `stdout`. The entire script comprises approximately 30 lines of code.\n\n```\nconst esprima = require('esprima');\nconst readline = require('readline');\n\n// console.log(x) or console['error'](y)\nfunction isConsoleCall(node) {\n    return (node.type === 'CallExpression') &&\n        (node.callee.type === 'MemberExpression') &&\n        (node.callee.object.type === 'Identifier') &&\n        (node.callee.object.name === 'console');\n}\n\nfunction removeCalls(source) {\n    const entries = [];\n    esprima.parseScript(source, {}, function (node, meta) {\n        if (isConsoleCall(node)) {\n            entries.push({\n                start: meta.start.offset,\n                end: meta.end.offset\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    entries.sort((a, b) => { return b.end - a.end }).forEach(n => {\n        source = source.slice(0, n.start) + source.slice(n.end);\n    });\n    return source;\n}\n\nlet source = '';\nreadline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin, terminal: false })\n.on('line', line => { source += line + '\\n' })\n.on('close', () => { console.log(removeCalls(source)) });\n\n```\n\nAn example run is shown in the following screenshot (the script is called `unconsole.js`). Note that the single call to `console.log` is eliminated in the output.\n\n![Console removal](https://docs.esprima.org/en/latest/_images/unconsole.png)\n\nThe script uses the [readline module](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) to read the input line-by-line, collecting each line to a buffer. Once there is no more input, it uses Esprima parser and utilizes the syntax delegate feature with a callback function that looks for a particular type of syntax node, i.e. a call expression with `console` object as the callee. The logic inside the `isConsoleCall` function is intended to match such a node. As an illustration, using the [Esprima online demo](http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html) to parse `console.log(\"Hello\")` will reveal the following syntax tree:\n\n![Call expression](https://docs.esprima.org/en/latest/_images/callexpr.png)\n\nFor each matched node, the node location is recorded. Once the parsing is completed, the list of the location of every matched call expression with `console` is used to modify the source, i.e. the portion of the source corresponding to the call expression is removed. When it is done repeatedly, the result is that every single `console` call will disappear. Note how this is done from the last one to the first one (reflected by the sorting in the reverse order) to maintain the correct offset throughout the process."

      "content": "The code provided in the Esprima documentation demonstrates how to use the Esprima library to parse JavaScript code and manipulate it by removing all `console` calls from the source code. Below is a breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. **Dependencies**: It imports the `esprima` library for parsing and the `readline` module from Node.js for reading input line by line.\n\n2. **Helper Function - `isConsoleCall`**: This function checks if a given node in the syntax tree is a call expression that represents a call to the `console` object (e.g., `console.log()`, `console.error()`). It confirms this by examining the structure of the node:\n   - The node should be of type `CallExpression`.\n   - The callee of the call should be a `MemberExpression` with its object being an `Identifier` named `console`.\n\n3. **Main Function - `removeCalls`**: This function takes a string `source` as input and:\n   - Uses Esprima's `parseScript` method to parse the string into a syntax tree.\n   - It employs the syntax delegate feature to traverse the syntax tree and look for any console calls using the `isConsoleCall` function.\n   - For each match, it records the starting and ending offsets of the console call in an array.\n\n4. **Adjusting Source Code**: After gathering all console call locations, it sorts them in reverse order (from the last console call to the first). This reverse ordering is crucial to ensure that removing a substring from the source does not affect the offsets of any later calls. It modifies the source string by slicing it to remove the identified console calls.\n\n5. **Reading Input**: The script reads input from standard input (stdin) line by line and accumulates it into a single string, `source`.\n\n6. **Output**: When the input has been completely read, it outputs the modified source code without any `console` calls.\n\nOverall, this script serves as a practical example of using the Esprima parser to analyze and transform JavaScript source code by deleting specific types of statements—in this case, any calls to the console methods. It highlights how to leverage the syntax tree returned by Esprima to ascertain the structure of the code and perform manipulations based on that structure.",
