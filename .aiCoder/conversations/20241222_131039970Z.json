      "content": "Based on common requirements for a full-featured NURBS library, I've identified several methods that could be added to our existing class structure. Here's an example of how these stubs might look:\n\n```javascript\nclass NurbsLibrary {\n   // ... Existing fields and methods\n\n   // Method to calculate the curve or surface normal at a given parameter(s)\n   getNormal(parameter) {\n      throw new Error(\"Method 'getNormal' must be implemented.\");\n   }\n\n   // Method to check if two NURBS objects are equal (considering their control points, knot vectors, etc.)\n   equals(otherNurbs) {\n      throw new Error(\"Method 'equals' must be implemented.\");\n   }\n\n   // Method to perform a Boolean operation (union, intersection, or subtraction) between two NURBS objects\n   booleanOperation(operationType, otherNurbs) {\n      throw new Error(\"Method 'booleanOperation' must be implemented.\");\n   }\n\n   // Method to trim the curve/surface based on a given interval or a set of intervals\n   trim(intervalOrIntervals) {\n      throw new new Error(\"Method 'trim' must be implemented.\");\n   }\n\n   // Method to perform a subdivision operation, creating a new NURBS object with more control points\n   subdivide(level) {\n      throw new Error(\"Method 'subdivide' must be implemented.\");\n   }\n\n   // Method to calculate the arc length of the curve at a given parameter range\n   arcLength(parameterRange) {\n      throw new Error(\"Method 'arcLength' must be implemented.\");\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThese stub methods provide placeholders for additional functionality that would be essential in a comprehensive NURBS library. Each method is marked with an error to indicate that it needs to be implemented according to the specific requirements of your project."
